# Rock Paper Scissors

An implementation of the game "rock paper scissors", this time with a GUI to allow players to play the game directly on the website.

As my first Javascript project, this project will mainly serve as an application of what I have learned and a review of where I need refreshers and improvements. 

The process was very fun, the main challenge coming with the step of modifying the game from a browser-based program to a GUI.

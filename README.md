# Rock Paper Scissors

An implementation of the game "rock paper scissors". The first version implements the game as a browser console using Javascript ; a GUI will be added later on. 

As my first Javascript project, this project will mainly serve as an application of what I have learned and a review of where I need refreshers and improvements.

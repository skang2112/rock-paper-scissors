- Header ("Rock, Paper, Scissors")

- Selection : 
    Pyramid arrangement, element triangle style 
    Button gets bigger when user hovers over it (animation depending on weapon?)
    Result text red or green depending on whether player wins or loses? Would have to do that in js directly though.

- Final score : 
    Blanks out whole screen, goes over? 
    Note : add "play again" button. (js)

- Everything center aligned
